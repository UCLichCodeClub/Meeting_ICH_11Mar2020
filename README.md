Tim Cole on the tidyverse in R -  the pipe, map and ggplot

Please create an RStudio directory, and copy the file Coding Club Tim Cole.R from this repository. Open RStudio and run this file, 
itâ€™s self-contained in that people with internet access can load everything quite quickly. But it would be quicker if you 
installed the libraries (first few lines) ahead of time.

The session will start with a very short (~4 minute) PowerPoint to explain the underlying statistical method. Please find it 
in the file LMS method for growth charts.pptx.
